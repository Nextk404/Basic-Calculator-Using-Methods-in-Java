A basic Java Calculator program using Methods(Same as functions lol, it is called methods because Java is a object oriented programming language ). Let me know what i should do next and suggest any improvements :))

Instructions for using program 

1. Dont forget to install Java and download a  suitable IDE to run the program. I prefer Intellj because of its usability, code ending feature and so much more.
