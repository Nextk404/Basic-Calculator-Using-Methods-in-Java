Instructions for using program 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dont forget to install Java and download a  suitable IDE to run the program. I prefer Intellj because of its usability, code ending feature and so much more. 
2. Dont forget to name the file the same name  as the class. Eg. If the class is called Test in your java program/application , the file name should be the same but with the .java extension included and vise versa. 
3. Just follow the intructions lol in the program and you wont have any issues :))
